The style of this control is taken from the UI toolkit. To implement in a Whiplash UI application, create an element `<input type="checkbox" class="toggle-input">` and the JS will create the required HTML structure to facilitate the complex styling of the element.

```html
showSource: true
---
<input type="checkbox" class="toggle-input">
```
